# Arch-Hyprland-Dots

Configuration files that I use for my Hyprland Installation. The mayority of the files used are part of [JaKooLit/Hyprland-Dots](https://github.com/JaKooLit/Hyprland-Dots) configurations.
That repository has instructions on how to install and use those dots.

This repository is mainly used to store personal config files.

I store my neovim configs in this repository [matiasgonzalezz0/Neovim-Config](https://github.com/matiasgonzalezz0/Neovim-Config).
